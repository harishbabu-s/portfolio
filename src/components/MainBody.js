This experience allowed me to hone my skills in both development and project management.\nIn the subsequent year, I transitioned to working with ABN amro Bank, Netherlands, where I focused on Azure cloud services and API development. This role enabled me to gain valuable experience in cloud technologies and API integration. ",

To broaden my skill set and pursue my goal of becoming a full stack developer, I've been expanding my knowledge in full stack technologies.\nAdditionally, driven by an interest in mobile app development, I completed a React Native specialization course.\nAt present, I am seeking opportunities where I can leverage both my front-end skills and my new full-stack capabilities. I am open to roles focused exclusively on front-end development as well as positions that offer the chance to apply my full-stack knowledge.
